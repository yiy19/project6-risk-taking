# Risk-Taking Decisions and Emotions

```{r import-data}

```


### Do people more risk-taking decisions for others than for themselves?


### Does that trend differ for females vs. males?


### Do people making decisions for others feel more or less negative emotions? Do negative emotions explain risk-taking levels? Do negative emotions influence decision making differently for personal decisions and for surrogate decisions?


### Do people making decisions for others feel more or less positive emotions? Do positive emotions explain risk-taking levels? Do positive emotions influence decision making differently for personal decisions and for surrogate decisions?


### What's the model of risk-taking levels? Is the effect of negative and positive emotions on risk-taking levels moderated by who is being decided for?
